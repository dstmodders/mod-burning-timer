# mod-burning-timer
Mod for the game Don't Starve Together to display fire durations to clients. 

# Overview
This mod displays a timer above burning objects or any campfire telling you the exact time until the fire goes out.

No Lag: This mod will not affect your ingame FPS
Clear Display: Timers will not stack on top of each other and only the shortest timer will be shown, giving you a clear display of when e.g. a stack with multiple items will start turning into ashes
Compatibility: It is compatible with other mods introducing new objects since timers are not hardcoded

Burning objects will be marked with a seconds timer which displays the remaining time until the object turns into its burned state or simply into ashes. Not every object has a constant burning timer (e.g. Gunpowder) or can be specified exactly without hardcoding (e.g. Lune Tree), if the timer is marked with [b](brackets)[/b] then the object may burn down during any time while that timer is counting down. Explosives will aditionally be marked with [b]!!exclamation marks!![/b], they tend to blow up and to deal damage once the timer ends so watch out for them.

Campfire, Fire Pit, Endothermic Fire, Endothermic Fire Pit, and Night Light do all show the amount of available fuel and their remaining burning duration depending on rain.
